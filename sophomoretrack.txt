What is Gas?
Gas is one of the most important and fundamental aspects of understanding the Ethereum network.

Gas is the fuel that allows it (Ethereum) to operate, in the same way that a car needs gasoline to run.

While going through the Freshman track tutorials, you may have noticed that transactions made on the Ethereum network require the users to pay a transaction fee.

How is this transaction fee calculated?
How much ETH do you need to pay for a transaction?
Why are some transactions more expensive than others?
Why do Gas Fees exist?
The answer to these questions lie within the concept of gas.

A recent upgrade, the London Upgrade of August 2021, slightly changed how transaction fees are calculated and how gas works. For that reason, we will break this tutorial into two sections:

Pre-London Upgrade
Post-London Upgrade
The Pre-London Upgrade is good to understand and easier to wrap your head around initially than the Post-London Upgrade, and also provides the motivation for the upgrade.
